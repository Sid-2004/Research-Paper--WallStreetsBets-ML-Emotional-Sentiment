Abstract

Retail trading behavior is heavily influenced by emotions such as fear, greed, and overconfidence, which often result in suboptimal or irrational decisions. Traditional algorithmic trading systems process financial data efficiently but fail to incorporate human psychological states into their strategies.

This project proposes a Real-Time Emotional Intelligence Engine that integrates multimodal emotion recognition‚Äîspeech, text, facial expressions, and physiological signals‚Äîinto retail trading bots. By leveraging deep learning architectures such as CNN-LSTM, DS-LSTM, MvVRNN, and MAS-DBN, along with sentiment mining techniques, the system dynamically adapts trading strategies in response to emotional cues.

The objective is to bridge the gap between behavioral finance and AI-driven trading, creating safer, emotion-aware, and resilient retail trading systems.

üéØ Research Motivation

Problem: Retail investors are prone to biases such as loss aversion, panic selling, and herd behavior.

Gap: Current trading bots are data-driven but emotion-agnostic.

Solution: Embed emotional intelligence into trading bots to reduce impulsive decisions and improve risk management.

üèóÔ∏è System Framework

The proposed system consists of the following modules:

Data Acquisition

Multimodal inputs: speech, text, facial expressions, EEG/physiological signals.

Emotion Recognition Engine

Deep learning models classify emotional states using CNN-LSTM, DS-LSTM, MvVRNN, and MAS-DBN architectures.

Sentiment Mining Module

Text-based sentiment analysis from financial forums (e.g., WallStreetBets), news, and social media.

Trading Strategy Engine

Emotional states mapped to trading rules (e.g., reducing exposure under stress, tightening stop-losses under fear).

Execution Layer

Adaptive strategies deployed in real-time trading environments.

üìö Research Foundations

This project is built on prior studies in:

Multimodal Emotion Recognition ‚Äì CNN-LSTM architectures (Firdous et al.)

EEG-based Trader Emotion Classification ‚Äì EEG + KNN achieving 98% accuracy (Torres et al.)

Multimodal Fusion ‚Äì MvVRNN (Moroto et al.), MAS-DBN (Qiao et al.)

Sentiment Mining in Finance ‚Äì Correlation between investor sentiment and market fluctuations (Chenrui)

Advanced Sequence Models ‚Äì Dual Sequence LSTM (DS-LSTM) for speech emotion recognition (Wang et al.)

‚úÖ This style makes your repo look research-oriented and professional, almost like a pre-publication supplement.

Would you like me to also design a diagram/flowchart (system architecture visualization) for your README so it looks more official and polished on GitHub?

Is this conversation helpful so far?
